# Next.js + TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a minimal and scalable boilerplate for Next.js projects, set up with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, .editorconfig, and Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean and efficient development workflow.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Jbuenoss/Next-js-Boilerplate.git
cd my-app
npm install
```

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Formatting

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```
